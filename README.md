Thanks for your interest in contributing to the ARK Ecosystem! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting pull requests**.

## Introduction

The ARK Community Fund runs a bounty program for merged pull requests for **Sponsored Repositories** which you can find at the bottom of this document.

### Guidelines

> Before sending a pull request, please make sure you follow the guidelines of the ACF and maintainer of the repository to make sure a certain standard is followed.

- **Each PR will be awarded once for a solved issue!** This means that if your PR solves 5 open issues at once it will only be awarded for 1 issue.
- Open an issue before sending a PR to inform the maintainer about the problem you are trying to solve.
- If the issue is security related, please contact the maintainer of the repository in private.

### Pull Requests

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

> To avoid this from happening, please get in touch with the maintainer of a repository before you start working on features that will cause breaking changes and require a new major release.

#### Accepted Pull Requests

- Bug fixes
- Implementation of new features
- Improve the public interface
- Improvement of documentation
- Improving test coverage
- Performance improvements
- Refactoring of existing functionality
- Refactoring of existing tests

### Sponsored Repositories

If you think your repository should be sponsored by the ACF, send a PR and we will review it.

> There are no sponsored repositories at the moment. Please submit a PR if you can think of a repository that should be sponsored.
